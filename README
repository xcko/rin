Abstract
--------
rin is a minimalistic FIFO and filesystem based tcp client. It
creates a directory tree with a FIFO in file and plain out file.

The in file is used to communicate with the host at the specified
port and the out file contains the server messages. For every new
host, new in and out files are created. 

The basic idea of this is to be able to communicate with a server
over tcp with standard command line tools. For example, say you
want to write an irc client and need to debug the sasl authentication
protocol. Connect rin to the specified host and write CON ACK :sasl
to the in file, you can now continue the interaction to determine
precisely what is needed and whether a server implements any
nonstandard features.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup. rin is installed into
/usr/local by default.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install rin (if
necessary as root):

    $ make clean install

Running rin
------------
Simply invoke the 'rin' command with required arguments.

The -d flag is used to specifiy a different root for the directory tree, which is $HOME/rin by default.

Configuration
-------------
Edit the source and recompile if configuration is needed.
